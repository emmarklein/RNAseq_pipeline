# RNA-seq pipeline

Who is excited to work with RNA-seq data? 

This repository includes everything you need for genome mapping. Raw FASTQ files serve as input (.fastq) and can be mapped back to a reference genome. This tutorial includes the T2T and GRCh38 reference.

background: rna seq videos, explain the pipeline process before going into each step

**Goal:** Genome mapping with STAR aligner
